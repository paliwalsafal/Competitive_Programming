# What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Programming is a mindsport where participants try to program solutions to various mathematical and algorithmic problems while adhering to run-time and system memory constraints.

# What is this repository?

This repostiory contains my solutions to programming challenges from multiple online judges. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a backup of all my solutions, and at the same time serve as a resource for fellow competitive programmers who are searching the internet for clues or solutions to problems that they are stuck on.

I should mention that none of these solutions are written with respect to best Software Engineering practices. The programs are written the way they are so that solutions to problems in competitions can be submitted as fast as possible. In some cases the solutions have small comments describing what the code is doing.
